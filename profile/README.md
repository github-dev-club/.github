## 👋 What is GitHub Dev Club?

GitHub Dev Club (GDC) is a community‑driven club for builders who live in the GitHub ecosystem and use whatever tools help them ship. Whether you're a VS Code power user, a JetBrains devotee, a Claude Code enthusiast, or a Codex developer — you belong here.

We're a **GitHub‑centric, fully tool‑agnostic** meetup. Come as you are, code how you like.

## 🎯 What to Expect

- **Practical insights** into real GitHub workflows and modern AI‑assisted development
- **Live demos** from local engineers and community builders
- **A friendly, social environment** to connect, share ideas, and learn from one another

## 🛠️ Who is This For?

GDC is for anyone who builds on or around GitHub:

- Open‑source maintainers & contributors
- Full‑stack, frontend, and backend developers
- DevOps / Platform engineers
- AI‑assisted development enthusiasts
- Students and early‑career developers looking to level up

No matter your editor, your language, or your stack — if GitHub is part of how you ship, you're in the right place.

## 🌍 Events

GDC is a **multi‑city meetup series**. We're bringing together builders, maintainers, and developers across growing tech communities for evenings focused on modern GitHub‑powered workflows, open tooling, and hands‑on learning.

Stay tuned for upcoming events in your city!
